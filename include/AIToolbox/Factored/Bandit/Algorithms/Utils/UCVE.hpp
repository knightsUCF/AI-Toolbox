     * @brief This class represents the UCVE process.
     *
     * This class implements variable elimination using bounds. It receives
     * as input a series of rules, one per PartialAction, containing both
     * an approximate value for the action, and a variance to keep track of
     * how much the rule could be actually worth.
     *
     * Internally, this uses a variation over
     * MultiObjectiveVariableElimination, where the two objectives are the
     * approximate value and the variance. Additionally, in order to be
     * more efficient, the agent removal process during Variable
     * Elimination computes an upper and lower variance bound for that
     * agent, in order to remove actions which cannot possibly be optimal
     * from the search.
     *
     * As this class doesn't really do much cleanup after solving a
     * process, it's probably best to create a separate instance for each
     * solving process.
