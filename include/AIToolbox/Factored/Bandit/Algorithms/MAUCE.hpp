     * @brief This class represents the Multi-Agent Upper Confidence Exploration algorithm.
     *
     * This algorithm is similar in spirit to LLR, but it performs a much more
     * sophisticated variable elimination step that includes branch-and-bound.
     *
     * It does this by knowing, via its parameters, the maximum reward range
     * for each group of interdependent agents (max possible reward minus min
     * possible reward). This allows it to estimate the uncertainty around any
     * given joint action, by keeping track for each PartialAction its upper
     * and lower bounds.
     *
     * During the VariableElimination step (done with UCVE), the uncertainties
     * are tracked during the cross-sums, which allows pruning actions that are
     * known to be suboptimal.
